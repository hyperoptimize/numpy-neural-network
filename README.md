# Project Title

Implementing a simple feedforward neural network using Numpy and train it
on MNIST dataset

## Getting Started

Install Numpy using pip
`pip install numpy`

Clone the repository
`git clone ... `

Download the data
`./data/download.sh`

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7
Numpy 1.13.3

## Running the nueral network

The parameters for the neural network is defined in train.py

To start the training, you can run
`python train.py`
